<p>My name is Michelle Io-Low. I am a PhD candidate Stony Brook University's Department of Political Science. Broadly speaking, my research interests centers around public opinion and political behavior. Much of my work centers around understanding how people form opinions related to economic inequality. I am studying how political ideology, political emotions, and political identities affect beliefs about inequality and redistribution, and the relevant political behaviors.</p> 

<p>In my dissertation, I propose an explanation as to why conservatives and liberals differ on their redistributive preferences, namely their preferences to redistribute from the rich. I contend that this difference in redistributive preferences arise because conservatives and liberals differ on how they perceive the rich. I utilize a series of methods such as, analyzing large-N observational data, conducting survey experiments, and analyzing media content to demonstrate my theoretical argument. </p>
